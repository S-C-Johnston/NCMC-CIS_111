		<h1>My work history</h1>

		<p>I've had a diverse set of jobs at this point in my
		life. When I was much younger, before I could legally
		work, I did street performance as often as I could. I
		juggled, and told bad jokes. I believe this helped me
		strengthen core social skills which I certainly lacked
		at the time. I became comfortable with asking, in a
		straightforward way, exactly what I needed of others.
		This is more broadly applicable in that I'm comfortable
		speaking on the phone. Granted I never did learn much to
		command an audience, since most of the people who did
		not interrupt me were being polite. My older brother has
		a bad habit of jumping on my words when I speak.</p>

		<p>Concurrent with street performance, and usually
		taking precedence, I worked at my family's metal shop in
		the summer. For several years, I didn't have the
		experience or clout to direct anything, just making and
		cleaning parts as needed. The most recent seasons,
		though, I had been largely directing the flow of parts
		and wrangling half-a-dozen employees, most of whom were
		not particularly experienced.</p>

		<p>Now I am in the CIS program, and pursuant to that
		end, I've held a handful of technician and support
		positions. I quite enjoy working with computers, most
		days. It's always frustrating when processes
		unexpectedly break, though.</p>

		<h1>Hobbies</h1>

		<p>I am more than just my work. I also enjoy several
		activities on a frequent basis, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Consuming (and arguing about) science
				fiction and fantasy media.  </li>	
			<li>Reading (and arguing about) roleplaying game
				books, their rules, and how best to
				gamify the things they try to model.
			Occasionally I'll actually have a chance to
			play, which is usually fun.  </li>	
			<li> Playing board games and video games with my
				friends.  Lately I've strongly preferred
				games which are simple to teach and easy
				to remember.  Carcassone is an excellent
				example, and while its rules are 2 or 3
				pages, this is mostly because it
				includes pictures to demonstrate legal
			moves. The summary is: match tiles to complete
			features you claim to get points.  </li>	
			<li> Work on or tinker with, sometimes called
				"ricing", my personal computers. I feel
				like if I don't have something to work
				on, I start to lose my mind a little
				bit. It's good to flex the skills and
				technical understanding.  </li>
		</ul>
