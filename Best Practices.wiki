Universal best practices
========================

 - Indent nested blocks of code. Code should be indented by one tab for
   each successive environment in which it is enclosed.
 - Open and close a tag or other block structure/matched pair immediately, before
   even inserting the content between the tags.

CSS
===

 - Using a class or id with the same name as a keyword is unwise. Avoid
   if possible.
