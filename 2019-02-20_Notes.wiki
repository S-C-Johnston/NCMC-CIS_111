Title tags
----------

- Title shows up in the tab-bar as the title of the tab. Search engines
  will tend to bias towards shorter titles, so no more than 65
  characters is good practice, but even shorter titles are more
  accessible to mobile users.

- Matched tags, seen as ``<title>``

Block elements vs inline elements
---------------------------------

- Block elements are meant to cover an entire width of the screen, and
  inline elements must exist nested inside a block element.

- Paragraph tag: ``<p>`` matched block tags, define, semantically, a
  paragraph of content. Does not care about whitespace in html.
- Pre-formatted tag: ``<pre>`` matched block tags, useful for making
  literal text and whitespace show on the screen as close as possible to
  how it is formatted in the html source.
- Blockquote tag: ``<blockquote>`` more matched block tags. Another
  semantic tag which can be styled to taste.
