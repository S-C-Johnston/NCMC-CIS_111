    <h2>Built to last!</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      Engineer and Machinist Art Johnston designed our fundamental system in 1962, and it has stood the test of time.
      Standardized components assemble easily to become a solid unified installed structure for summer.
      Then disassemble in the fall to be safely stored away from the crushing ice.
    </p>
    <h3>The Proper Tool</h3>
    <p class="indent flush_b">
      Every job has the right tool and Northern Michigan weather creates unique requirements.
      Well designed products require a delicate balance of critical features.
      Our dock system is the best investment in your waterfront because of our commitment to the ideal balance.
    </p>
    <ul class="">
      <li>Strength vs Weight</li>
      <li>Stability vs Mobility</li>
      <li>Quality vs Cost</li>
      <li>Standardization vs Flexibility</li>
      <li>Form vs Function</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Better with Age</h3>
    <p class="indent flush_b">
      Many of our docks are still in service decades later.
      Yet since Art's time we have continued to refine our system.
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet_wrap">
      <li>Modern tooling improved Quality and lowered Cost.</li>
      <li>Additional components increased Flexibilty without complicating Standardization.</li>
      <li>Newly available materials improved both Form and Function.</li>
